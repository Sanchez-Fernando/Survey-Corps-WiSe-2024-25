# Survey Corps Python Project
Remarks:
**Bold** words are aspects that are subject to change.
## Description
We will be working on the default project. This will be a **web** based program acting as a seat reservation site for flights.  
## Functionalities

### Data Sources and Retrieval
The plan is to use a dataset from **kaggle** to get flight information reduced to a specific place and time; if this doesnt work out there is also the option to randomly generate a large number of flights.
### Data Storage and Handling
The data will be handled using **SQL**.
### User Management
There is a login system with two types of accounts: customers and administrators.
The admin has access to certain functions through higher privileges such as canceling any reservation or viewing statistics (more to be determined later).
The database contains userID, name, user_name and a password.
The customer can book a reservation upon confirmation which he can also cancel.
### Interface

### Statistical Analysis
The mandatory statistics will be available:

- Number and percentage of available seats
- Number and percentage of reserved seats
- List of available seats 
- List of seats that are not available
- Number of users in the system with their information, except for their password

Plus seat prices and cashflow. 
These statistics will have also a graphical representation.

### Visualizations
Mathplotlib will be used for the visualization of charts and graphics.
## Installation and Usage
This is to be explained later.
